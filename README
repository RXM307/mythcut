Install instructions:
* You need at least PHP 5.1
* You need have mplayer installed
* copy to a path of your choice, for ubuntu you might want /var/www/mythcut
* if you have /etc/mythtv/config.xml and it is readable to the apache user, you are done.

Configuration
=============
There are a few configuration settings, the defaults are found in lib/config-defaults.php. If you want
to make changes, copy lib/config-defaults.php to lib/config.php and make your changes in this file. This
file takes precedence over the default-config-file.
